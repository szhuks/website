Independent, versatile consultant based in Amsterdam.

## What I do
My name is Sophia Zhukovsky. I'm a freelance professional with over six years of experience in project management, research, operations, and administrative support. 

## Where I work:

## Background:

After earning my BA in Political Science in my home state of New York, I decided it was time to engage with the world at an even greater level. I moved to the Netherlands to complete an MSc in Global Environmental Change and Policy, and I'm now priviliged to call Amsterdam my home base.

Over the years, I've worked in climate tech, UN-affiliated nonprofits, and community centric-spaces. I've co-developed and delivered large-scale conferences, designed climate tech pilots, and supported EU grant applications. No two experiences have been alike, and the adaptability I've gained through the process is exactly my superpower.

I care deeply about sustainability, because to me, it means more than buzzwords or frameworks. It means building an organization or initiative that contributes to its community, advancing causes from social equity to environmental protection. I'm deeply passionate about using my versatile skillset to help you achieve outcomes that matter.
