## What I do, and why I do it.
My name is Sophia Zhukovsky. I'm a freelance professional with over six years of experience in project managemet, research, operations, and administrative support. I have an BA in political sciences and an MSc in environmental change & policy, bothf which have launched my interest in achieving a sustainable future. Over the years, I've worked in climate tech, non-profits, and community centric-spaces. Through these diverse settings, I've built a truly unique and comprehensive approach to my work that I am eager to lend to your organization. 

I care deeply about sustainability, because to me, it means more than buzzwords or frameworks. It means building an organization or initiative that contributes to its community, advancing cause from social equity to environmental protection. I'm deeply passionate about using my versatile skillset to help you achieve outcomes that matter.
